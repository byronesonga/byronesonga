I'm currently on an exciting journey into the world of backend development through the intensive and hands-on ALX Africa Software Engineering Program. With a strong focus on building scalable, secure, and efficient systems, I’m learning to solve real-world problems using technologies like Python, Django, SQL.
I’m especially passionate about:
•	Designing and building robust APIs
•	Learning system design principles
•	Exploring database architecture and data modeling
•	Collaborating on open-source or team-based software projects
While I’m still growing my technical skill set, I bring with me a strong work ethic, curiosity, and problem-solving mindset—qualities that I apply to every challenge and project.
 Current Focus:
•	Building projects with Python and Django
•	Understanding software development best practices
•	Preparing for internships, freelance opportunities, and remote work in backend engineering
 I’m open to connecting with fellow learners, mentors, and professionals in tech. Let’s grow together! Reach me out through byronesonga68@gmail.com
